	<h3 class="mb-3">About</h3>
	<p>We all know that data is one of the most valuable commodities in the modern era and getting it to the right people at the right time and in the most appropriate format is critical for businesses.</p>
	<p>We achieve this through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and there are lots of frameworks to choose from, REST, JSON-RPC, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, etc... However, it is nigh on impossible for businesses to provide each and every interface to support developers and clients in utilising their data.</p>
	<p>Here at LetsGraphQL, we &#10084; <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as it communicates the underlying data model irresepctive of the backend systems that store and power it. <strong>Our mission</strong> is to make the Internet GraphQL-able. Be it through middleware on existing APIs or working directly with backend systems.</p>
	<p>Our opensource projects are funded by our kind and generous sponsors under MIT licenses. Even our main website is opensource!</p>
	<p>By providing GraphQL APIs to the Internets data, we aim to maximise the use of data so we can continue to see incredible applications and products that will help society.</p>

	<h4 class="mb-3">Organisation Sponsorship üè¢</h4>
	<p>Not sure what API you want to see GraphQL'd or just want to make the internet a GraphQL better place? You can sponsor the organisation directly and we will use the funds to fuel the development of GraphQL APIs and the management of the services that enable you to use them freely in your apps.</p>
	<p>This funding will support opensource middleware that you can download and run on your own services or just use the servers we provide. We also produce blogs detailing the architectures, software best practices and neat things we find along the way as we aim to deliver the best GraphQL experience possible.</p>
	<h4 class="mb-3">Project Sponsorship üìã</h4>
	<p>Or, have a look at our GraphQL projects and sponsor one that you would like to see and use in your application. Can't see an API listed? Then please contact us at <a href="mailto:queries@letsgraphql.org">queries@letsgraphql.org</a> and we can start up a project for you to sponsor.</p>

		<h5 class="card-title">SWAPIQL</h5>
		<p class="card-text">A GraphQL wrapper around <a href="https://swapi.dev/">The Star Wars API (SWAPI)</a>. This is a great demonstration of how we wrap a GraphQL service around a REST API. Use the playground to interact and see what the API has to offer. The data model is visible using voyager.</p>
		<p>The endpoint is <code>https://api.letsgraphql.org/swapiql/graphql</code></p>
		<p>Want to run the service or see the underlying code? Then head over the to docker image and GitHub repository.</p>
